## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Option 1 (Recommended) - Running with Docker

### Prerequisites

In order to run the project with a Docker infrastructure, make sure Docker is installed on your system.
If it is not, you can follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">these steps</a> for an Ubuntu-based system

### Running the server

In order to run the server, open up a terminal in the backend root directory and run

```
docker compose up
```

<b>Now, it is necessary to run the migrations. To do so, open a terminal and run: </b>

```
docker exec -it backend-ibreno-1 sh -c "npx prisma migrate dev"
```

<b>Every time the prisma schema file is altered, the database must be updated with:</b>

```
docker exec -it backend-ibreno-1 sh -c "npx prisma migrate dev"
```

### Prisma studio
If you wish to manage the databaese in a graphical way, you can use Prisma Studio. To do so, run:

```
docker exec -it backend-ibreno-1 sh -c "npx prisma studio"
```

Now, from your browser, access http://localhost:5555

## Option 2 - Running without Docker

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MySQL

### Installing

Clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```

npm install

```

### First time running ?

Run the follow scripts

```

chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
chmod +x .husky/pre-push

```

```

npm run

```

### Environment

This project uses `.env` files to manage environment variables. You can create a `.env.dev` file in the project directory and set the environment variables in the file (You can create it from .`env.example`). The `env` script in the `package.json` file uses the `env-cmd` package to load the environment variables from the `.env.dev` file.

One crucial step is to correctly configure MySQL connection URL into the `.env` file. If you don't know how to do so, make sure to check <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-mysql">this post</a>

### Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```

env=dev npm run start

```

This command will run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and start the server using nodemon.

### Executing Migrations

If it is the first time the server is being executed. To do so, open a terminal and run:

```

npx prisma migrate dev

```

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `package.json` file:

- `start`: Runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and starts the server using nodemon.
- `build`: Compiles the TypeScript code.
- `test`: Runs the Jest tests for the project.
- `prettier`: Formats the code using Prettier.
- `lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in the project:

- [env-cmd](https://github.com/toddbluhm/env-cmd): A simple way to manage your environment variables in npm scripts.
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [jest](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript): Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino): Very low overhead Node.js logger.
